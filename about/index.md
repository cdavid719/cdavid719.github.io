Hello everyone! My name is **David Castillo**, I'm 26, from Miami, Florida. I am currently studying to obtain my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. I've always been intrigued in technology. From learning how to build/repair computers, to making simple applications on Python. I am very determined to learn more and get into an industry in which I can expand my skills in development and technology.
